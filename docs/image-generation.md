# Image Generation in MakeMy.blog

The site generator now supports two ways to generate images using AI:

## 1. Inline Image Generation in HTML

When generating HTML content, you can include images that will be automatically generated by adding special data attributes:

```html
<img
  data-gen-image="true"
  data-context="A serene mountain landscape at sunset"
  data-style="watercolor"
  data-width="800"
  data-height="600"
  alt="Mountain landscape at sunset in watercolor style"
/>
```

### Attributes:

- `data-gen-image="true"` - Marks the image for AI generation
- `data-context` - Description of the image to generate (required)
- `data-style` - Optional style (e.g., photo, illustration, watercolor, oil painting)
- `data-width` - Optional width in pixels (default: 512)
- `data-height` - Optional height in pixels (default: 512)
- `alt` - Alt text for accessibility (required)

## 2. Direct Image Generation

You can also generate images directly by requesting them with a specific URL pattern:

```
/images/[name]-[style]-[dimensions].[ext]
```

For example:

- `/images/hero-watercolor-800x600.png`
- `/images/profile-photo-512x512.jpg`
- `/images/background-abstract.png`

### URL Pattern Components:

- `name` - Base name that describes the image (required)
- `style` - Optional style modifier (e.g., watercolor, photo)
- `dimensions` - Optional dimensions in WxH format (e.g., 800x600)
- `ext` - File extension (.jpg, .png, etc.)

The image generation will use the site's prompt and the URL components to generate a contextually relevant image.

## Implementation Details

- Images are generated using the configured LLM provider (currently supporting Gemini)
- Generated images are returned as base64 data or URLs depending on the provider
- Images are cached to improve performance and reduce API calls
- The system gracefully handles providers that don't support image generation

## Best Practices

1. Always provide descriptive context for better image generation
2. Include meaningful alt text for accessibility
3. Consider using consistent styles across your site
4. Use appropriate dimensions for your use case (larger isn't always better)
5. Cache generated images when possible to improve performance

## Examples

### Hero Image

```html
<img
  data-gen-image="true"
  data-context="A modern workspace with a laptop, coffee cup, and natural lighting"
  data-style="photo"
  data-width="1200"
  data-height="600"
  alt="Modern workspace setup with laptop and coffee"
/>
```

### Profile Picture

```html
<img
  data-gen-image="true"
  data-context="Professional headshot of a person smiling"
  data-style="photo"
  data-width="512"
  data-height="512"
  alt="Professional headshot"
/>
```

### Decorative Background

```html
<img
  data-gen-image="true"
  data-context="Abstract geometric patterns in soft pastel colors"
  data-style="illustration"
  data-width="1920"
  data-height="1080"
  alt="Abstract geometric background pattern"
/>
```
